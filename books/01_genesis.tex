\bversenonum \firstletter{R}{itual} is one of many ways we encode information for our descendants.
\bversenopar Perhaps it is more accurate to say that ritual is one method by which our ancestors have encoded wisdom for their descendants;

\bverse for our survival beyond today is never a guarantee.

\bverse Indeed, four decades ago the natural philosophers Michael Hart and Frank Tipler first posed a question today known as the Fermi paradox.

\bverse That is, given the sheer number of stars in the sky, the probability of us being the only intelligent species to evolve is vanishingly small;

\bverse but if we are not alone, why is there such silence?

\bverse This Great Silence suggests the existence of filters: the transition from single-celled life to multi-cellular; access to an environment conducive to use of fire and electricity; a social structure which supports the development of technology and infrastructure; and so on.

\bverse In the last century, we have been met by several filters simultaneously.

\bverse First and foremost, we confront the risk of nuclear weapons.

\bverse Secondly, our emphasis on an economics based on consumption has created the illusion that our resources are infinite, even while we recognize the risk of an artificial, catastrophically changing climate.

\bverse Thirdly, it is unclear we have the sociopolitical willpower and foresight to build the interplanetary civilization we will need to ensure our species survives the first two filters.

\bverse Few if any of our existing holy books have much to say about the challenges we face, which are wholly different from those faced by our pre-singularity ancestors.

\bverse We call the narrow road that carries us safely through these filters the Golden Path.

\bverse \textsc{The Book of Dust} is a holy book for the next thousand years.

\bverse It is an attempt to encode wisdom and guidance for our descendants that will help them to be the people we wish we were.

\bverse It is intended as a map of the Golden Path.

\bverse We, the Keepers of the Book, have placed books in various locations --- each book with a unique theme corresponding to its setting --- to gather wisdom from as many people as possible as we work to elucidate this Path.

\bverse We plan to incorporate the best Writings and Artwork from each of these books into the final \textsc{Book of Dust}, which we shall gift to people.

\bverse Religion has frequently been used to control people; but the \textsc{Book} puts control of religion back in the hands of modern people.

\bverse Indeed, books and freedom --- \textit{libre} --- are synonymous in many languages.

\bverse\textsc{The Book} represents a democratization of religion.

\bverse We hope you will share rituals, icons, and arabesques; we hope you will gift us your psalms, your myths, and your fables.

\bverse The Golden Path belongs to all of us;

\bverse we cannot find it without a collective effort of monumental proportions.
