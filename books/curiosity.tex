\bversenonum \firstletter{S}{o often}, the claim is made that one can only be left-brained or right-brained, and not both; \\
\\
\bverse yet mathematicians consider themselves to be artists, and no science would be possible without creativity. \\
\\
%\bverse As Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ``Science does not know its debt to imagination.'' \\
%\\
\bverse Moreover, \textit{Engineering} shares a root with \textit{ingenuity}, which literally means creativity. \\

\bverse What connections have you found between curiosity and creativity? \\

\bversenonum \firstletter{A}{ll gods} have to come into being somehow; otherwise, who could possibly worship the God of Bioengineering before there ever was such a thing as bioengineering? Tell the story of the creation or birth of the God of Space Travel.
\newpage%s{3}
\bversenonum \firstletter{W}{rite} your favorite proof of the Pythagorean Theorem as a limerick, or in other poetic form, or --- if you prefer --- as a fictional narrative.

\bversenonum \firstletter{S}{uppose} for a moment that we establish a colony of only a few dozen people on another world. To ensure sufficient genetic diversity, it is necessary to promote cultural norms that resemble what we call polyamory. Writing or illustrating in the style of Dr.~Seuss, tell the story of this new society.

\bversenonum \firstletter{M}{athematical} writing is a common theme in ancient texts relating to religion and ritual. The \textit{Baudh\=ayana Shrautas\=utra} includes an approximation for $\sqrt{2}$ and possibly also the Pythagorean theorem: ``A rope stretched along the length of the diagonal produces an area which the vertical and horizontal sides make together.''

\bverse Sir Isaac Newton believed the physical dimensions and proportions given for the Temple of Solomon in the Hebrew and Christian holy book were a sacred geometry which encoded mathematical and physical theory.

\bverse What mathematical and physical theorems would you include in a future ancient text? How would you encode them?

\bversenonum \firstletter{A}{ll that has by nature}, with systematic method, been arranged in the universe, seems both in part and as a whole to have been determined and ordered in accordance with number, by the forethought and the mind of him that created all things; for the pattern was fixed, like a preliminary sketch, by the domination of number pre\"existent in the mind of the world-creating \textsc{g}od, number conceptual only and immaterial in every way, but at the same time the true and the eternal essence, so that with reference to it, as to an artistic plan, should be created all these things: time, motion, the heavens, the stars, all sorts of revolutions. \textit{---Nicomachus}

\bverse As his close friend and cosmonaut colleague Alexei Leonov tells it, then-premier Nikita Khrushchev cornered Gagarin. ``So tell me, Yuri,'' he asked, ``did you see \textsc{g}od up there?'' \\
\\
\bverse After a moment's pause, Gagarin answered, ``Yes sir, I did.'' \\
\\
\bverse Khrushchev frowned. ``Don't tell any one,'' he said. \\
\\
\bverse A few minutes later the head of the Russian Orthodox Church took Gagarin aside. ``So tell me, my child,'' he asked Gagarin, ``did you see \textsc{g}od up there?'' \\
\\
\bverse Gagarin hesitated and replied, ``No sir, I did not.'' \\
\\

\bversenonum \firstletter{I}{t is important for scientists to be aware} of what our discoveries mean, socially and politically. It's a noble goal that science should be apolitical, acultural, and asocial, but it can't be, because it's done by people who are all those things. \textit{---Mae Jemison}
